        Not much news in the last few months, but don't worry, its not
        dead yet, just developing rather slowly and jumpy. The <a
        href="artworks.html">artwork section</a> contains some new
        pieces (<a href="artworks.html#hero">here</a> and <a
        href="screenshots.html#effects">here</a>) of graphics which might
        be worth a look. You want to see the Windstille artwork in its
        purest or rawest form, you can now find it in the <a
      href="http://undone.clanlib.org/~grumbel/show.cgi?search=windstille">Game
      Media Repository</a>.

        A updated <a href="download.html">Win32 release</a> is
        available, fixes the small bugs mentioned below.

        Thanks to <a href="mailto:rkon@gmx.de">Robert Konrad</a> we
        now have a Win32 build of the <a href="download.html">0.2.0
        Windstille release</a>, known bugs for that release include
        the lack of the exit-trigger, so once you have reached the
        exit, you have to press Escape.

      <item date="02. Feb 2004">
        Added another, a bit more detailed, <a
        href="images/artwork10.jpg">artwork of the Windstille
        hero</a>. Win32 release will hopefully follow real soon. Hint:
        If anybody wants to help maintaining the Win32 builds and thus
        lead to faster release cycles and less workload on myself,
        tools for doing that (MinGW, ClanLib, Voribs, etc.) are all
        Free Software and freely downloadable from the net..

        Windstille 0.2.0 is out, at the moment just the GNU/Linux is
        available, Windows version will follow soon. There is also a
        video of it available <a href="http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-400x300-xvid.avi">here</a>.

        A first Win32 release got crossy-compiled, not public available,
	but it should ensure that following Windows ports should be doable
	in relativly small amounts of time.

      <item date="13. Aug 2003">
        <a href="download.html">Windstille 0.1.0</a> is out, both the
        full source and a static binary for GNU/Linux are provided,
        this is the first useable Windstille version. Its currently
        not more then a simple techdemo so don't expect anything
        playable.
